A browser extension that converts Codeforces problem statements into a clean, LeetCode-style description. It focuses only on the main problem statement and keeps the original input, output, examples, and notes sections unchanged.​

Features
Simplifies verbose Codeforces statements into concise, technical language using an LLM.​

Renders mathematical expressions (subscripts, superscripts, inequalities) using KaTeX-style formatting for better readability.​

Preserves the original page layout and only replaces the problem description block, with a toggle to switch between original and simplified views.​

Uses a user-provided Gemini API key stored locally in the browser.​

Usage
Install the extension in your browser.

Open any Codeforces problem page.

Click the Simplify button above the problem statement to toggle between the original and LeetCode-style versions.​
